# 🤖 Machine Learning Basics

Machine Learning (ML) is the field of study that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. In this lesson, we'll explore the fundamentals of ML, including types of learning, key algorithms, and essential concepts like training, validation, and testing.

## ✨ What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning can be defined as the process of using mathematical models to **learn from data**. By identifying patterns and correlations within data, ML models can make informed predictions or decisions. 

> **Quote to Remember**:
> *"Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."* - Arthur Samuel

### 🔍 Key Concepts:
- **Model**: The system or mathematical function that learns from data to make predictions.
- **Algorithm**: The method used to train the model.
- **Training Data**: The data used to teach the model.
- **Prediction/Inference**: The process where the model generates output based on learned patterns.

## 📋 Types of Machine Learning

There are three primary types of ML based on the nature of the learning process and the available data:

### 1. **Supervised Learning**
   - **Definition**: The model learns from labeled data, where both input (features) and output (labels) are known.
   - **Goal**: To map input data to the correct output label.
   - **Examples**:
      - **Classification**: Identifying categories, such as spam detection in emails.
      - **Regression**: Predicting continuous values, like house prices.
   - **Visual Representation**:

      ```plaintext
      Input Data ➡️ Model ➡️ Prediction
                 ⬆️              ⬇️
              Training
            Labeled Data
      ```

### 2. **Unsupervised Learning**
   - **Definition**: The model learns from unlabeled data, aiming to discover structure within the data.
   - **Goal**: To identify patterns, groupings, or structures.
   - **Examples**:
      - **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points, like customer segmentation.
      - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Simplifying data, such as using PCA for feature reduction.
   - **Visual Representation**:

      ```plaintext
      Input Data ➡️ Model ➡️ Patterns/Groups
                 ⬆️                ⬇️
              Training
           Unlabeled Data
      ```

### 3. **Reinforcement Learning**
   - **Definition**: The model learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties for actions.
   - **Goal**: To maximize cumulative rewards by making a sequence of decisions.
   - **Examples**:
      - Game AI, like agents that learn to play chess.
      - Robotics, where robots learn to navigate environments.
   - **Visual Representation**:

      ```plaintext
      Agent ➡️ Action ➡️ Environment
               ⬇️             ⬆️
             Reward        New State
      ```

## 🔧 Essential Concepts in Machine Learning

### 1. **Training, Validation, and Testing**

The ML process is typically divided into three stages: 

- **Training**: The model learns patterns using a labeled dataset.
- **Validation**: Used to tune model parameters and avoid overfitting.
- **Testing**: The model is evaluated on unseen data to assess generalization.

> **Example**:
> In a dataset of 1000 records, a common split would be:
> - 70% for training
> - 15% for validation
> - 15% for testing

---

### 2. **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**

The **Bias-Variance Tradeoff** is a fundamental ML concept describing a balance between two types of errors:

- **Bias**: Error due to overly simple models. High bias leads to **underfitting**.
- **Variance**: Error due to models that are too complex. High variance leads to **overfitting**.

Balancing these errors is key to building models that generalize well on new data.

### 3. **Overfitting and Underfitting**

- **Overfitting**: When the model learns the training data too well, including noise, and fails to generalize.
- **Underfitting**: When the model fails to capture underlying patterns in the data.

## 🔍 Key Machine Learning Algorithms

### Supervised Learning Algorithms

1. **Linear Regression**:
   - **Purpose**: Predict continuous values.
   - **Example**: Predicting house prices.
   - **Formula**: 
     $$y = wx + b$$

     where $y$ is the predicted value, $x$ is the feature, $w$ is the weight, and $b$ is the bias.

2. **Logistic Regression**:
   - **Purpose**: Binary classification.
   - **Example**: Determining if an email is spam (1) or not (0).
   - **Formula**:
     $$\text{P(y=1|x)} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(wx + b)}}$$

3. **Decision Trees**:
   - **Purpose**: Classification and regression.
   - **Example**: Predicting customer churn.
   - **Key Components**:
     - **Nodes**: Represent features.
     - **Edges**: Decision outcomes.

4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**:
   - **Purpose**: Classification, especially for complex decision boundaries.
   - **Example**: Face recognition.

### Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

1. **K-Means Clustering**:
   - **Purpose**: Group similar data points.
   - **Example**: Segmenting customers by buying behavior.
   - **Process**:
     - Randomly initialize cluster centroids.
     - Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
     - Update centroids based on cluster members.

2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:
   - **Purpose**: Dimensionality reduction.
   - **Example**: Reducing features in image data.
   - **Process**:
     - Transform data to a new basis that captures maximal variance.

## 📊 Model Evaluation Metrics

Evaluating the performance of ML models involves selecting appropriate metrics based on the task:

### 1. **Classification Metrics**

- **Accuracy**: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.

  $$\text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{True Positives + True Negatives}}{\text{Total Instances}}$$

- **Precision**: The ratio of true positives to all predicted positives.

  $$\text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives + False Positives}}$$

- **Recall**: The ratio of true positives to all actual positives.

  $$\text{Recall} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives + False Negatives}}$$

- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both.

  $$F1 = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{Precision} \cdot \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision + Recall}}$$

### 2. **Regression Metrics**

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**:

  $$\text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \hat{y}_i|$$

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:

  $$\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$$

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**:

  $$\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\text{MSE}}$$

# Sample data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Feature': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'Label': [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
})

# Split data
X = data[['Feature']]
y = data['Label']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Model initialization and training
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Prediction and evaluation
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")
```
