## 🔍 Types of AI

AI can be broadly categorized based on its **capabilities** and **functionality**. Here's a look at some common types:

### 1. **Narrow AI (Weak AI)**
   - Focused on one specific task (like language translation or facial recognition).
   - Examples: **Google Search**, **Siri**, **Spam Filters**.

### 2. **General AI (Strong AI)**
   - Theoretical form of AI capable of performing any intellectual task a human can do.
   - Currently **non-existent**, but it’s the ultimate goal of many AI researchers.

### 3. **Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)**
   - A hypothetical AI that surpasses human intelligence in all fields.
   - Exists only in **theories and science fiction** for now.
